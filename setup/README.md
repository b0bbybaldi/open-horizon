# Open Horizon Setup

This repository contains sample scripts to automatically setup nodes for [Open Horizon][open-horizon] as provided in the IBM Cloud.  Detailed [documentation][edge-fabric] for the IBM Cloud Edge Fabric is available on-line.  A Slack [channel][edge-slack] is also available.  You may create and publish your patterns to your organization.  Refer to the [examples][examples] available on GitHub.

You will need an [IBM Cloud][ibm-cloud] account and IBM MessageHub credentials available in the Slack [channel][edge-slack].

# System Installation

System level installation modifies the operating system image boot sequence to install the Open Horizon software.  This technique is suitable for replication.  Please refer to [these][system] instructions.

# Network Installation

Installations can be performed over the network when devices are discovered.  This technique is suitable for early-adopters. Please refer to [these][network] instructions.
