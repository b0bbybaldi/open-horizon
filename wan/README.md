# `wan` - Wide-Area-Network monitoring service

Monitors Internet access information as [Open Horizon][open-horizon] service; updates periodically (default `1800` seconds or 15 minutes).

## Open Horizon

This service provides a LINUX container for the `wan` microservce.  This container may be run locally using Docker as well as published to an [_Open Horizon_][open-horizon] exchange and any Docker registry.

## Use

### Node registration

Nodes should _register_ using a derivative of the template `userinput.json` [file][userinput].
```
% hzn register -u {org}/iamapikey:{apikey} -n {nodeid}:{token} -e {org} -f userinput.json
```
### Service publishing

Prior to _publishing_ the `service.json` [file][service-json] must be modified for your organization.

+ `org` - `dcmartin@us.ibm.com/wan`
+ `url` - `com.github.dcmartin.open-horizon.wan`
+ `version` - `0.0.1`

## Architecture

This service supports the following architectures:

+ `arm` - RaspberryPi (armhf)
+ `amd64` - AMD/Intel 64-bit (x86-64)
+ `arm64` - nVidia TX2 (aarch)

### Copy

Copy repository, edit `service.json` for your organization; `build`, `test`, and `publish` targets for `make`; see below:

```
% mkdir ~/gitdir
% cd ~/gitdir
% git clone http://github.com/dcmartin/open-horizon .
```

### Build
```
% cd ~/gitdir/open-horizon/wan
% make
...
{
  "hostname": "4d1438b77650-172017000007",
  "org": "dcmartin@us.ibm.com",
  "pattern": "wan",
  "device": "newman-amd64_wan",
  "pid": 10,
  "wan": null
}
```
The `wan` value will initially be `null` until the service completes its initial execution.  Subsequent tests should return a completed payload.

### Test
```
% curl -sSL 'http://localhost:'8581

# About Open Horizon

Open Horizon is a distributed, decentralized, automated system for the orchestration of workloads at the _edge_ of the *cloud*.  More information is available on [Github][open-horizon].  Devices with Horizon installed may _register_ for patterns using services provided by the IBM Cloud.

## Credentials

**Note:** _You will need an IBM Cloud [account][ibm-registration]_

Credentials are required to participate; request access on the IBM Applied Sciences [Slack][edge-slack] by providing an IBM Cloud Platform API key, which can be [created][ibm-apikeys] using your IBMid.  An API key will be provided for an IBM sponsored Kafka service during the alpha phase.  The same API key is used for both the CPU and SDR addon-patterns.

# Setup

Refer to these [instructions][setup].  Installation package for macOS is also [available][macos-install]

# Further Information

Refer to the following for more information on [getting started][edge-fabric] and [installation][edge-install].

## Changelog & Releases

Releases are based on Semantic Versioning, and use the format
of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- ``MAJOR``: Incompatible or major changes.
- ``MINOR``: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- ``PATCH``: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.
